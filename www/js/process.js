<h3>So Sick</h3>

<p>By: Ne-Yo</p>
<div>
<p>Do do do do do do do-do</p>
<p>Ohh Yeah</p>

<p>[Verse 1]</p>
<p>Gotta change my answering machine</p>
<p>Now that I'm alone</p>
<p>'Cause right now it says that we</p>
<p>Can't come to the phone</p>
<p>And I know it makes no sense</p>
<p>'Cause you walked out the door</p>
<p>But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore</p>
<p>(it's ridiculous)</p>
<p>It's been months</p>
<p>And for some reason I just</p>
<p>(can't get over us)</p>
<p>And I'm stronger than this</p>
<p>(enough is enough)</p>
<p>No more walking round</p>
<p>With my head down</p>
<p>I'm so over being blue</p>
<p>Crying over you</p>
<p>[Hook]</p>
<p>And I'm so sick of love songs</p>
<p>So tired of tears</p>
<p>So done with wishing you were still here</p>
<p>Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow</p>
<p>So why can't I turn off the radio?</p>

<p>[Verse 2]</p>
<p>Gotta fix that calendar I have</p>
<p>That's marked July 15th</p>
<p>Because since there's no more you</p>
<p>There's no more anniversary</p>
<p>I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you</p>
<p>And your memory</p>
<p>And how every song reminds me</p>
<p>Of what used to be</p>
<p>That's the reason</p>

<p>[Hook]</p>
<p>And I'm so sick of love songs</p>
<p>So tired of tears</p>
<p>So done with wishing you were still here</p>
<p>Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow</p>
<p>So why can't I turn off the radio?</p>

<p>[Bridge]</p>
<p>(Leave me alone)</p>
<p>Leave me alone</p>
<p>(Stupid love songs)</p>
<p>Don't make me think about her smile</p>
<p>Or having my first child</p>
<p>I'm letting go</p>
<p>Turning off the radio</p>

<p>[Hook]</p>
<p>And I'm so sick of love songs</p>
<p>So tired of tears</p>
<p>So done with wishing you were still here</p>
<p>Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow</p>
<p>So why can't I turn off the radio?</p>
<p>(why can't I turn off the radio?)</p>
<p>And I'm so sick of love songs</p>
<p>So tired of tears</p>
<p>So done with wishing you were still here</p>
<p>Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow</p>
<p>So why can't I turn off the radio?</p>
<p>(why can't I turn off the radio?)</p>
<p>And I'm so sick of love songs</p>
<p>So tired of tears</p>
<p>So done with wishing you were still here</p>
<p>Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow</p>
<p>So why can't I turn off the radio?</p>

<p>[Outro]</p>
<p>Why can't I turn off the radio?</p>
<p>Why can't I turn off the radio?</p>

				<p>If you ever leave me, baby</p>

				<p>I'll never be your mother's favorite</p>
				<p>Your daddy can't even look me in the eye</p>
				<p>Ooh if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing</p>
				<p>Saying there goes my little girl</p>
				<p>Walking with that troublesome guy</p>
				<p>But they're just afraid of something they can't understand</p>
				<p>Ooh well little darling watch me change their minds</p>
				<p>Yea for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try</p>
				<p>I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding</p>
				<p>If that'll make you mine</p>
				<p>Cause there'll be no sunlight</p>
				<p>If I lose you, baby</p>
				<p>There'll be no clear skies</p>
				<p>If I lose you, baby</p>
				<p>Just like the clouds</p>
				<p>My eyes will do the same if you walk away</p>
				<p>Everyday, it will rain</p>
				<p>Rain, rain</p>

				<p>Ooh Don't you say</p>
				<p>Goodbye, don't just say, goodbye</p>
				<p>I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding</p>

				<p>She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home</p>
				<p>I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets</p>
				<p>To carry love, to carry children of our own</p>
				<p>We are still kids, but we're so in love</p>
				<p>Fighting against all odds</p>
				<p>I know we'll be alright this time</p>
				<p>Darling, just hold my hand</p>
				<p>Be my girl, I'll be your man</p>
				<p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms</p>
				<p>I see my future in your eyes</p>
				<p>Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song</p>
				<p>When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath</p>

				<h6>When I Was Your Man</h6>
				<p>By: Bruno Mars</p>
			<div>
				<p>Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now</p>
				<p>Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same</p>
				<p>When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down</p>
				<p>'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name</p>
				<p>It all just sounds like oooooh ooh</p>
				<p>Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize</p>
				<p>That I should have bought you flowers</p>
				<p>And held your hand</p>
				<p>Should have gave you all my hours</p>
				<p>When I had the chance</p>
				<p>Take you to every party</p>
				<p>'Cause all you wanted to do was dance</p>
				<p>Now my baby's dancing</p>
				<p>But she's dancing with another man</p>
				<p>My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways</p>
				<p>Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out of my life</p>
				<p>Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)</p>
				<p>And it haunts me every time I close my eyes</p>
				<p>It all just sounds like oooooh ooh</p>
				<p>Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize</p>
				<p>That I should have bought you flowers</p>
				<p>And held your hand</p>
				<p>Should have gave you all my hours</p>
				<p>When I had the chance</p>
				<p>Take you to every party</p>
				<p>'Cause all you wanted to do was dance</p>
				<p>Now my baby's dancing</p>
				<p>But she's dancing with another man</p>
				<p>Although it hurts</p>
				<p>I'll be the first to say that I was wrong</p>
				<p>Oh, I know I'm probably much too late</p>
				<p>To try and apologize for my mistakes</p>
				<p>But I just want you to know</p>
				<p>I hope he buys you flowers</p>
				<p>I hope he holds your hand</p>
				<p>Give you all his hours</p>
				<p>When he has the chance</p>
				<p>Take you to every party</p>
				<p>'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance</p>
				<p>Do all the things I should have done</p>
				<p>When I was your man</p>
				<p>Do all the things I should have done</p>
				<p>When I was your man</p>

				<p>What would I do without your smart mouth?</p>
				<p>Drawing me in, and you kicking me out</p>
				<p>You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down</p>
				<p>What's going on in that beautiful mind</p>
				<p>I'm on your magical mystery ride</p>
				<p>And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright</p>
				<p>My head's under water</p>
				<p>But I'm breathing fine</p>
				<p>You're crazy and I'm out of my mind</p>

				<p>Even when I lose I'm winning</p>
				<p>'Cause I give you all of me</p>
				<p>And you give me all of you, oh oh</p>
				<p>How many times do I have to tell you</p>
				<p>Even when you're crying you're beautiful too</p>
				<p>The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood</p>
				<p>You're my downfall, you're my muse</p>
				<p>My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues</p>
				<p>I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you</p>

				<p>Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them</p>
				<p>But I hope I never see them again</p>
				<p>I know it breaks your heart</p>
                <p>Moved to the city in a broke down car</p>

				<p>And I-I-I can't stop</p>
				<p>No, I-I-I can’t stop</p>
				<p>So baby pull me closer</p>
				<p>In the backseat of your Rover</p>
				<p>That I know you can't afford</p>
				<p>Bite that tattoo on your shoulder</p>
				<p>Pull the sheets right off the corner</p>
				<p>Of the mattress that you stole</p>
				<p>From your roommate back in Boulder</p>
				<p>We ain't ever getting older</p>
				<p>We ain't ever getting older</p>
				<p>We ain't ever getting older</p>
				<p>You look as good as the day I met you</p>
				<p>I forget just why I left you, I was insane</p>
				<p>Stay and play that Blink-182 song</p>
				<p>That we beat to death in Tucson, okay</p>
